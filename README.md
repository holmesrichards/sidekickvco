This is a work in progress.

**Untested hardware â€” Do not assume anything works!**

This is a stripped-down VCO for use alongside the Hero VCO. It lacks any front panel inputs or controls for frequency CV, pulse width settings, or pulse width CV. Instead it receives the same summed CVs as the Hero uses. There are an octave switch and a fine tune knob to set an offset frequency. There also is a switch to enable hard or soft sync with the Hero. 

The idea is for this to be the same design as the Hero but with most inputs removed and a link input header added. Link output header can be preserved for daisy chaining. The octave switch and fine tune will have to be modified to center them around 0 V.
