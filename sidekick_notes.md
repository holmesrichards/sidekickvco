In Sidekick:
LINK CV goes through 100k to CV_NODE (summed inside 3340)
LINK FM goes through 10nF + 1M to LIN_FM (summed inside 3340)
LINK PW goes through 100k to PWM summing amp (summed outside 3340)
LINK SAW goes to SYNC

If sync is enabled then we probably don't want to use the link CV. Might need a DP3T sync switch? Er, no such thing (readily). CV enable switch? Tight space on the panel. Hm. OK... DPDT on-off-on. When on, it sends a voltage to an NC analog switch like DG417 (20 Î© on resistance).

Would there be a use for a Hero Breakout module? Just link to 4 buffered jacks...
