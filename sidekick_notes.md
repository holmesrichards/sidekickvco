In Sidekick:
LINK CV goes through 100k to CV_NODE (summed inside 3340)
LINK FM goes through 10nF + 1M to LIN_FM (summed inside 3340, need to breadboard)
LINK PW goes through 100k to PWM summing amp (summed outside 3340)
LINK SAW goes to SYNC

Would there be a use for a Hero Breakout module? Just link to 4 buffered jacks...

## Caveat emptor

Bourns 3296P 10k trimmers are specified for the panel accessible trimmers. Similar trimmers from other manufacturers *may* differ slightly in their dimensions which may cause misalignment between panel and PCB. Compare datasheets carefully before buying. Bourns is more expensive than some but was chosen because it seems more readily available.

The jacks are from Tayda, SKU A-1122 or A-3617 (seemingly identical). This appears to be the same as jacks sold under the model number PJ-644C elsewhere. Again, similar looking jacks from other sources may have slightly different dimensions.
