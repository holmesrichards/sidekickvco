In Sidekick:
LINK CV goes through 100k to CV_NODE (summed inside 3340)
LINK FM goes through 10nF + 1M to LIN_FM (summed inside 3340, need to breadboard)
LINK PW goes through 100k to PWM summing amp (summed outside 3340)
LINK SAW goes to SYNC

Would there be a use for a Hero Breakout module? Just link to 4 buffered jacks...

Current thinking on structure:

* Panel mounted octave switch to Molex to main board
* Panel mounted fine tune pot to Molex to main board
* 3 Panel mounted jacks (tri, ramp, lin FM) to Molex to main board
* Sync switch on new PCB with mounting screws attached to panel with Molex to main board
* 4 board mounted jacks and 4 side screw trimmers attached to main board which is perpendicular
* Possibly two main boards as perpendicular sandwich
